# REACT CODE SAMPLES

## next.js-react-typescript-hooks/incident-overview.tsx
Code samples I've recently built with Next.js, React.js, Typescript, and Hooks

## react-hooks-context/farm.tsx
Code samples built with React, Hooks, and Context API

## react-mui-hooks-context
Code samples built with React, Hooks, Context, and Material-UI
On this project, I customized Material-UI themes to fit with the desired design. The code style is a little unconventional because I used snake_case for the variable name convention and the code was also written in one file, which was the client's requirement.
